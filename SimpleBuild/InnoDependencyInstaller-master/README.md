# Inno Setup Dependency Installer

**Inno Setup Dependency Installer** is a set of Inno Setup scripts and a bunch of Pascal code that extends the functionality of [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) installer to provide the possibility of dependencies installation (such as .NET Framework or Visual C++ Redistributable) during installing your product on end-user workstations.

## Installation and usage

No installation is required. Just [download](https://github.com/stfx/innodependencyinstaller/archive/master.zip) the repository and edit _setup.iss_ file as usual.
